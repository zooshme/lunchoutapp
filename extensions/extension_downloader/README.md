# Extension Downloader

Version: 1.1.x

> An extension that makes it easy to download others extensions directly from the backend.

### SPECS ###

You can download extensions by specifying:

- A custom zipball (https://github.com/DeuxHuitHuit/extension_downloader/zipball/master)
- A specific github repo (DeuxHuitHuit/extension_downloader)
- The extension handle (extension_downloader)
- Keywords: will do a search on <http://symphonyextensions.com/>

### REQUIREMENTS ###

- Symphony CMS version 2.3 and up (as of the day of the last release of this extension)
- You'll need to make sure PHP's Zip module is enabled (--enable-zip). 
If you're on a shared server, your host would have had to do this when PHP was compiled.

### INSTALLATION ###

- `git clone` / download and unpack the tarball file
- Put into the extension directory
- Enable/install just like any other extension

You can also install it using the [extension downloader](http://symphonyextensions.com/extensions/extension_downloader/).
