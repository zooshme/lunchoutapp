# Storage

This Symphony extension creates a front-end storage using native PHP sessions.

Storage allows the creation of nested data arrays of any kind with three restrictions:

- The first key level in the storage array is considered the group name, this allows the creation of different storage contexts. For example a shopping cart and a list of user settings.
- Each item can contain a reserved key `count` which is used to store the amount of an item. Storage will automatically recalculate this count on update which is usefull for creating inventories.
- Each item can contain a reserved key `count-positive` which behaves exactly the same as `count` except the fact that the corresponding item will be dropped from the storage array if the resulting numeric value is not positive (i.e. negative or zero). This is usefull for creating shopping carts where clients are not supposed to order negative or zero amounts of items.

All count values must be integers, float values will be considered invalid and will be ignored.

Both `count` and `count-positive` keys will not result in items but attributes in the datasource output (see examples). These keys can be used independently, which means even at the same time.


## Symphony 2.2.x Support

There is a 2.2.x Git branch of this extension which is compatible with Symphony 2.2.x. It is always __ahead of master__ and will be rebased on master if needed. This approach makes it easier to keep pace with development in the master branch. The downside is that it must be pushed to GitHub with the `--force` flag, thus overwriting history in that branch.


## Events

Storage is a standalone class (`/lib/class.storage.php`) that can be used to create custom events. But the extension bundles a default event that should be sufficient for most cases. It offers four actions:

- **set:** to set new groups and items, replacing existing values
- **set-count:** to set new groups and items, replacing existing values and recalculating counts
- **drop:** to drop entire groups or single items from the storage
- **drop-all:** to drop the storage completely

These actions can be triggered by either sending a `POST` or `GET` request, where the latter is especially useful for drop actions. Please be really careful with using the `drop-all` action which will definitely empty your full storage and cannot be undone.

### Example Form

This example form will update a shopping basket by raising the amount of `article1` by 3 (using the `count-positive` key).

```html
// Set item count
<form action="" method="post">
	<input name="storage[basket][article1][count-positive]" value="3" />
	<input name="storage-action[set-count]" type="submit" />
</form>
```

Dropping items can be done by either passing items that should be removed like in the example above or by appending these items to the action directly. Both forms will have the same result:

```html
// Drop item by passing is separately
<form action="" method="post">
	<input name="storage[basket][article1][count-positive]" value="3" />
	<input name="storage-action[drop]" type="submit" />
</form>

// Drop item from within the action
<form action="" method="post">
	<input name="storage-action[drop][basket][article1]" type="submit" />
</form>
```

The second option is suited for complex forms that need to handle set and drop actions simultaneously: if items are appended to the drop action directly, other items will be ignored.

#### Event Redirection

Like default Symphony events, Storage's default event supports adding a hidden input field to redirect the user to another location after the event has passed successfully:

```html
<input name="redirect" type="hidden" value="example.com" />
```

This is a useful feature, if you are sending `GET` requests and would like to remove the parameters from the URL after the event executed.

### Example Output

```xml
<events>
	<storage-action type="set-count" result="success">
		<request-values>
			<group id="basket">
				<item id="article1">
					<item id="count-postive">3</item>
				</item>
			</group>
		</request-values>
	</storage-action>
</events>
```

### Example Error Output

```xml
<events>
	<storage-action type="set-count" result="error">
		<message>Storage could not be updated.</message>
		<message>Invalid count: Value of 'count-positive' is not an integer, ignoring it.</message>
		<request-values>
			<group id="basket">
				<item id="article1">
					<item id="count-postive">3.5</item>
				</item>
			</group>
		</request-values>
	</storage-action>
</events>
```

## Data Sources

Storage also bundles a custom Data Source interface offering filtering by groups. If no filters have been specified, the Data source will return the full storage.

Optionally, it's possible to output the selected groups as parameters. Those output parameters will follow the Symphony naming convention of `$ds-` + `Data Source name` + `.` + `group name`, e. g. `$ds-storage.basket` and will contain the ids of the group's direct child items.

### XML Output

```xml
<storage>
	<group id="basket">
		<item id="article1" count-positive="4" />
		<item id="article2" count-positive="8" />
		<item id="article3" count-positive="11" />
	</group>
</storage>

<ds-storage.basket>
	<item handle="article1">article1</item>
	<item handle="article2">article2</item>
	<item handle="article3">article3</item>
</ds-storage.basket>
```

### Parameter Output

```xml
$ds-storage.basket: 'article1, article2, article3'
```

### 2.2.x Branch

Due to missing core features in Symphony 2.2.x, the 2.2.x branch of this extension can not provide the above datasource possibilities. Instead it provides a simpler, hardcoded datasource which will output the complete storage to XML. The XML node is `storage`. The parameter output will use dashes instead of dots to build the group names.

These parameter names unfortunately mean that Symphony can not resolve the auto-generated datasource dependency if you use a Storage output parameter to filter a second datasource. To make it work properly, you will need to edit the second datasource's __dependencies array__. Use `$ds-storage` instead of the full parameter name:

	$this->_dependencies = array('$ds-storage');

(Don't forget to make the `allowEditorToParse()` function return false, so your changes can not be overwritten from the Symphony backend.)


## Event Filter

Version 1.4.2 of this extension introduces an event filter which can be used to drop items from the storage if an event is successful (using the EventFinalSaveFilter delegate). This may be useful e.g. for shopping carts: You can drop the cart items from the storage when an order is saved.

You will have to add the event filter to your save event, then add a hidden field to your form like so:

```html
<form action="" method="post">
	<label>Foo
		<input name="fields[foo]" type="text" />
	</label>
	<label>Bar
		<input name="fields[bar]" type="text" />
	</label>
	<input type="hidden" name="storage-action[drop][cart]" value="1">
	<input type="submit" name="action[save-order]" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

The hidden field's naming convention is the same as for the Storage event (see above). So when the event filter is used, the Storage event must not be attached to the page.


## Example: Shopping Cart with Product Variants

Say you'd like to create a shopping basket for a store that offers products in different colour variants. Each product should be shown on a separate page where the user can choose a colour and add the desired amount to the basket. A list of all available variants doesn't seem appropriate to you because there might be quite a lot of different colours. So you decide to have a select box with the colours and an input field for the amount:

```html
<form action="" method="post">
	<fieldset>
		<label>Colours
			<select>
				<option>red</option>
				<option>blue</option>
				<option>green</option>
			</select>
		</label>
		<label>Amount
			<input id="amount" type="text" name="?" value="1" />
		</label>
	</fieldset>
	<button type="submit" name="storage-action[set-count]">Add to basket</button>
</form>
```

Now you run into a problem: in order to connect colours and amounts, you need to have specific input names for each colour that store the chosen amount â€“ `storage[basket][red][count]`, `storage[basket][blue][count]`, `storage[basket][green][count]`. This cannot be achieved with the given select box. In order to get your desired behaviour you need to create a different HTML structure first and apply your layout using JavaScript later on:

```html
<form action="" method="post">
	<fieldset>
		<legend>Colours</legend>
		<label><input type="text" name="storage[basket][red][count]" value="1" />red</label>
		<label><input type="text" name="storage[basket][blue][count]" value="1" />blue</label>
		<label><input type="text" name="storage[basket][green][count]" value="1" />green</label>
	</fieldset>
	<button type="submit" name="storage-action[set-count]">Add to basket</button>
</form>
```

Based on this markup you can now create your layout by iterating over the given colours and set the name of the amount field dynamically as soon as the user switches colours in the select box.

(You'll do it that way to get your shop working with and without JavaScript, don't you? And you won't forget to add styles for _both_ layouts either, right? Perfect!)
